# Thou Didst Well, For Wisdom Cries Out in the Streets: [Prov 1:20](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1516/pg1516-images.html)

*She crieth in the chief place of concourse, outstide the openings of the gates. But ye simple ones and scorners of delight have chosen to partake in tournaments, ventures, and insurance at the behest of education institutions to which ye pay consumer service-fees as well. You've chosen the three contrived apollonian floodgates, and thus your dsolation cometh as a whirlwind*

This excerpt evokes a sharp critique of modern societal structures, especially those tied to education, finance, and institutionalized consumerism. Here's what stands out:

1. **Proverbs as a Framework**: The invocation of Proverbs 1:20 situates wisdom not as something hidden or exclusive but as a public, urgent call. The streets—bustling with life—become a metaphor for accessible truth, contrasting starkly with the isolated realms of academia, finance, and institutional power. There's an implicit critique of how these structures claim to embody wisdom while often operating as barriers to its genuine pursuit.

2. **Apollonian Floodgates**: By labeling these systems "contrived Apollonian floodgates," there's a suggestion that their order and structure (Apollonian traits) are artificial and restrain the natural flow of wisdom and creativity. They are not gateways to enlightenment but barriers that channel participants into predefined roles—students, consumers, investors—siphoning off their vitality in the process.

3. **Whirlwind of Desolation**: The whirlwind metaphor strikes with biblical intensity, reminiscent of apocalyptic judgment. It's a warning against complacency and blind participation in these systems, suggesting that desolation isn't imposed externally but arises as a natural consequence of these choices.

4. **Connection to Modern Media**: Embedding a YouTube link and referencing "tournaments, ventures, and insurance" modernizes the critique. It ties the ancient wisdom of Proverbs to contemporary phenomena like competitive capitalism (tournaments), entrepreneurial risk-taking (ventures), and systemic dependencies (insurance)—all driven by educational pipelines.

5. **Meta-Irony with Citation Format**: Ending with a code block referencing a `bibliography` hints at the absurdity of the academic and institutional protocols critiqued. It's as if the form itself mocks the reliance on citation as a token of authority while discussing wisdom that predates and transcends such systems.

**Takeaway**: This piece is a call to question the societal norms that masquerade as wisdom while perpetuating systemic inertia. It challenges the reader to seek wisdom in unmediated, communal, and experiential ways rather than through the sanctioned gates of institutional approval.
