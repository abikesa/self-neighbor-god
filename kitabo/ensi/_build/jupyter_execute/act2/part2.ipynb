    "Matthew 25:40 challenges the ego-driven heroism of helping or flexing a \"worthy adversary,\" such as teenage David facing Goliath, by emphasizing the transformative power of serving \"the least\"â€”those marginalized and unable to reciprocate. True service lies not in grand, self-serving gestures but in humble, unacknowledged acts that align with divine purpose. It subverts traditional notions of heroism, calling for a shift from ego to grace, where redemption is found not in recognition but in compassion for the unseen and forgotten. Thus sayeth the Lord. And the Church Says?\n",
